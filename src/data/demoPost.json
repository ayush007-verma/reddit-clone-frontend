The previous fastest was off 45 balls by Meg Lanning against New Zealand Women in 2012, while the previous quickest in men's ODIs was by Maxwell himself, who made a 51-ball hundred against Sri Lanka in the 2015 World Cup.3 Only three ODI hundreds have come in fewer balls than Maxwell's 40-ball effort against Netherlands. AB de Villiers hit a 31-ball century against West Indies in 2015, which is the fastest by anyone in the format, followed by Corey Anderson (36 balls against WI) and Shahid Afridi (37 balls against Sri Lanka)",
